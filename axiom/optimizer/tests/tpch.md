# TPC-H Plans

This document covers TPC-H with Verax under different configurations of execution (single node and scale-out) and different data layouts, as in bucketed with optional sorting on keys.

We wil extend this as support is added to the different data layouts and access methods. We begin with analyzing multithreaded single node execution. Subsequent sections will cover differences brought by distributed execution or different data layouts.

## Environment

We run the single node experiments using axiom_sql on a laptop against a 30G dataset with Parquet and snappy.  To repeat the below runs, use the query formulations in tpch.queries. To see plans and stats, use

SQL> flag optimizer_trace = 15;
SQL> flag include_runtime_stats = true;
SQL flag num_workers = 1;
SQL> flag num_drivers = <number of core threads>;

We set num_workers = 1 to force single node plans. These run faster on a single system and are easier to read when we do not have exchanges between stages.

## Single Node Multithreaded Execution

###Q1

The query is a simple scan of lineitem with a very low cardinality
group by. All the work is in the table scan (65%( and partial
aggregation (30%).




###Q2

The query takes partsupp info for a set of parts and a set of
suppliers limited by geography. the selection on supplier is 1/5 and
the selection on part is 1/300. So we first join partsupp with part
and then with supplier. Then we get to the correlated subquery. This
is flattened into a left join against a group by on the correlation
keys which are p.p_partkey and s.s_suppkey. The aggregate is the min
of cost. When building the group by, we add a semijoin with part that
comes from the probe side so that we do not calculate the min cost for
parts that will in any case not be probed.

The one-line plan is:

```
partsupp t4*H
  (part t2
    Build
  )*H
  (supplier t3*H
    (nation t5*H
      (region t6
        Build
      )
      project 2 columns
      Build
    )
    project 7 columns
    Build
  )*H left
  (partsupp t8*H exists
    (part t2
      Build
    )*H
    (supplier t9*H
      (nation t10*H
        (region t11
          Build
        )
        project 1 columns
        Build
      )
      project 1 columns
      Build
    )
    PARTIAL agg
    FINAL agg
    project 1 columns
    Build
  )
  order by 4 columns
  project 8 columns
```



Note the exists with part in the subquery right of the left outer
join. The existence being more selective than the supplier join, we do
the existence first. This lan is likely the best or very close. The
group by from hte subquery is smaller than partsupp, so doing this as
a left outer join instead of right hand is better.



###Q3

The query is straightforward to do by hash. We select 1/5 of customer
and 1/2 of orders. We first join orders x customer, build on that and
then probe on lineitem. There is nticorrelation between the date
filters on lineitem and orders but that does not affect the best plan
choice.

###Q4

The trick in q4 is using a right hand semijoin to do the exists. If we
probed with orders and built on lineitem, we would get a much larger
build side. But using the right had semijoin, we get to build on the
smaller side.  If we had shared key order between lineitem and orders
we could look at other plans but in the hash based plan space we have
the best outcome.

Q5

The filters are on region and order date. There is also a diamond between supplier and customer, this being that they have the same nation.
We get the plan:

```
lineitem t4*H
  (supplier t5*H
    (nation t6*H
      (region t7
        Build
      )
      project 2 columns
      Build
    )
    project 4 columns
    Build
  )*H
  (orders t3
    Build
  )*H
  (customer t2
    Build
  )
  project 2 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 1 columns
  project 2 columns
```



Lineitem is the driving table that is joined to 1/5 of supplier and
then 1/7 of orders. Finally we join with customer on c_custkey and
c_nationkey. The build of customer could have been restricted on
c_nationkey being in the range of s_nationkey but we did not pick this
restriction because this would have gone through a single equality in
a join edge of two equalities. The plan is otherwise good and the
extra reduction on customer ends up not being very important. This is
a possible enhancement for completeness.

###Q6

We have a single scan, so there are no query optimization choices here.

###Q7

The query has filters on lineitem ship date and on customer and
supplier nation. The trick is to understand the customer from france
and supplier from Germany or customer from Germany and supplier from
France construct. Customers not from France or Germany and suppliers
not from France or Germany cannot be part of the result. The condition
is broken up and pushed down into the scans of nation that are a
reducing join against both customer and supplier.  The plan that we
get:

```
lineitem t3*H
  (supplier t2*H
    (nation t6
      Build
    )
    project 2 columns
    Build
  )*H
  (orders t4*H
    (customer t5*H
      (nation t7
        Build
      )
      project 2 columns
      Build
    )
    project 2 columns
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
  project 4 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 3 columns
  project 4 columns
```



first joins with supplier because this is the smaller table and the reduction is the same as the one with orders, i.e. 2/25 in both cases. The biger table is slower to probe so we reduce with the smaller one first.

###Q8

The query has filters on region, selecting 1/5 of supplier or customer
and the most selective filter on part, plus 2/7 selection on orders.

The join order of first joining with part and then orders joined with customer makes sense, doing the more reducing join first. At the tail we have supplier and the supplier's nation.

```
lineitem t4*H
  (part t2
    Build
  )*H
  (orders t5*H
    (customer t6*H
      (nation t7*H
        (region t9
          Build
        )
        project 1 columns
        Build
      )
      project 1 columns
      Build
    )
    project 2 columns
    Build
  )*H
  (supplier t3
    Build
  )*H
  (nation t8
    Build
  )
  project 3 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 1 columns
  project 2 columns
```


###Q9

The plan is a natural join of lineitem, orders, part, partsupp, supplier and nation. The only selection is 1/17 of part.

The outcome is actually quite ingenious. One would think we should begin with lineitem x part. Instead we get:

```
orders t6*H
  (partsupp t5*H
    (lineitem t4*H
      (part t2
        Build
      )
      project 6 columns
      Build
    )
    project 7 columns
    Build
  )*H
  (supplier t3
    Build
  )*H
  (nation t7
    Build
  )
  project 3 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 2 columns
  project 3 columns
```



We get a complicated build side that has 1/17 of lineitem as a build
and partsupp as a probe. Since partsupp is 1/8 of lineitem, building
on the join of lineitem and part builds on the smaller, as one
should. Then we probe this with orders, which is 1/4th of lineitem,
thus the biggest table. The rest is just 1:1 joins to supplier and
nation.


###Q10

The join order is as expected, from largest to smallest. The trick
question here is that the grouping keys are functionally dependent on
c_custkey, so do not need to figure in hte group by at all. This
information is not known because the schema does not have primary key
information, so we cannot take advantage of this.

```
lineitem t4*H
  (orders t3
    Build
  )*H
  (customer t2
    Build
  )*H
  (nation t5
    Build
  )
  project 8 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 1 columns
  project 8 columns
```




###Q11

The join order is the usual, from large to small. The only particularity is the non-correlated subquery that repeats the same join steps. An optimization opportunity could be to reuse build sides but this is not something that Velox plans support at this time. Also, Practical need for this is not very high.

###Q12


In this query, we end up building on lineitem since the filters on it
make it the smaller of the two tables. Everything else is
unsurprising.

###Q13

This query has only two possible plans, left and right hand outer
join. We correctly produce the right outer join, building on the left,
i.e. customer, as it is much smaller than orders.


###Q14

The only noteworthy aspect is that we build on lineitem since its
filters (1 month out of 7 years) make it smaller than part.

###Q15

The plan

```
lineitem t4
  project 2 columns
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  project 2 columns
*H
  (lineitem t6
    project 2 columns
    PARTIAL agg
    FINAL agg
    project 1 columns
    PARTIAL agg
    FINAL agg
    project 1 columns
    Build
  )*H
  (supplier t2
    Build
  )
  order by 1 columns
  project 5 columns
```


We join with the aggregation on lineitem, which is the most selective join available for the first lineitem, , then we join with supplier.

###Q16

The join is biggest table first, with  part joined first because it is quite selective, more so than the exists with supplier.

Q17

The trick here is that we have a correlated subquery that flattens
into a group by that aggregates over all of lineitem. We correctly
observe that only lineitems with a very specific part will occur on
the probe side, so we copy the restriction inside the group by as a
semijoin (exists).

```
lineitem t2*H
  (part t3
    Build
  )*H left
  (lineitem t5*H exists
    (part t3
      Build
    )
    PARTIAL agg
    FINAL agg
    project 2 columns
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  project 1 columns
```


###Q18


This query has exotic optimization possibilities that have to do with pushing down the top k through order by. Velox does not have execution support for this though.

The standard full scan + hash join model of executing will as usual
probe with the larger tables, producing the order lineitem, orders,
customer. There is the subquery with lineitem with an actually very
selective having.  The best join order would be lineitem x subquery x
orders x customer. We get

```
lineitem t4*H
  (orders t3
    Build
  )*H exists-flag
  (lineitem t6
    PARTIAL agg
    FINAL agg
    filter 1 exprs
    project 1 columns
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
*H
  (customer t2
    Build
  )
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 2 columns
  project 6 columns
```


instead because the semijoin edge to the subquery is not translated
via the equivalence class of l_orderkey, o_orderkey. If this were an
inner edge it would be. So, expanding implied edges outside of just
inner join edges would improve the plan by a little.

##$#Q19

The trick is to extract common pieces to push down into the scan of
lineitem and part from the or of three ands in the single where clause.
We extract the join condition that is present in all three disjuncts
of the or. Then we extract an or to push dowbn into the scan of part
and lineitem.  We build on part, as it is the smaller table.

###Q20

This is one of the harder queries. The main filters are 1/25 of
supplier nations, 1/7 years of lineitem and ~1/20 of part.  The larger
compute is the subquery with lineitem that adds up the volume for part
and supplier combinations.

The subquery flattens into a left oj with a group by derived table on the right.

```
lineitem t7
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  project 3 columns
*H right
  (partsupp t5*H exists-flag
    (part t11
      project 1 columns
      Build
    )
    filter 1 exprs
  *H exists
    (supplier t2*H
      (nation t3
        Build
      )
      project 1 columns
      Build
    )
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
  project 1 columns
*H right exists-flag
  (supplier t2*H
    (nation t3
      Build
    )
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
  order by 1 columns
  project 2 columns
```



We should have the exists with part inside the aggregation on
lineitem. To do this we need to consider existences as well as inner
joins for when gathering reducing joins.

###Q21

The key insight is that the exists and not exists will apply to only
1/50 or so of lineitem. The worst plan would be to build hash tables
on the contents of the subqueries.

The plan we get builds on lineitem l1 joined to supplier joined to nation joined to orders. This is probed in a right hand semijoin by the scan of lineite l2 and this is built and then probed by lineitem l3 in a right semijoin. The rigright semijoin flags marks the build side rows that get probed by the semijoined side and once the probe is complete, flags are produced for al build side rows to indicate if they were hit.

The plan is  as expected.

```
lineitem t7
  project 2 columns
*H right exists-flag
  (lineitem t9
    project 2 columns
  *H right exists-flag
    (lineitem t3*H
      (supplier t2*H
        (nation t5
          Build
        )
        project 2 columns
        Build
      )*H
      (orders t4
        Build
      )
      Build
    )
    filter 1 exprs
    Build
  )
  filter 1 exprs
  PARTIAL agg
  FINAL agg
  order by 2 columns
  project 2 columns
```


###Q22


The query is straightforward, with the not exists resolved with a
right semijoin and the non-correlated subquery becoming a cross join
to the one row result set of the non-grouped aggregation.
